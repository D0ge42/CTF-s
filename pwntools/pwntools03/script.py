# This ctf let us use both a binary file and a binary file hosted on a server.
# It checks if REMOTE is given as argument.
# If so it connects to the remote server, else it uses the binary file.
# We'll have to provide the function addresses that are situated inside the ELF file.
# Goal is to complete 20 steps in 10 seconds.
